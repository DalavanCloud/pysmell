PySmell v0.6

*UNRELEASED*

Added module completion. Please regenerate your TAGS. Completing import
statements works, but the messages may look a bit wonky.


PySmell v0.5

Bug fix: infinite loop when no PYSMELLTAGS is found.


PySmell v0.4

Improved class detection: Now works even for classes which are not present in PYSMELLDICT
Improved import handling: "absolute" imports work, as well as imported name detection.
This version sort-of correctly handles Django (not the dynamic part of course!)


PySmell v0.3

Added simple type-inferencing when inside classes, hardcoded to "self". It will present methods and properties
of current and parent classes (but not built-in types). It only works with relative imports for now.
When you auto-complete right after a function/method call's opening parenthesis, the arguments will be filled in.
You can select out of seven matching behaviours - look in pysmell.vim for possible options.
Big improvements on correctness of PYSMELLTAGS files.

Bugfix: Set Vim to display duplicate arguments
Bugfix: change name of omnifunc so to not clash with built-in python omnicompletion


PySmell v0.2

Added support for nested packages
Exceptions in files are not blocking the process
Switched to parseFile, shouldn't have to worry about line endings


PySmell v0.1 

Initial, roughly working version
